# re Standart Library

Regular expressions (called REs, or regexes, or regex patterns) are essentially a tiny, highly specialized programming language embedded inside Python and made available through the re module.

## The special characters
| symbol | meaning |
| ------ | ------ |
| . | (Dot.) In the default mode, this matches any character except a newline. |
| ^ | (Caret.) Matches the start of the string, and in MULTILINE mode also matches immediately after each newline. |
| $ | Matches the end of the string or just before the newline at the end of the string, and in MULTILINE mode also matches before a newline. |
| * | Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or more repetitions of the preceding RE, as many repetitions as are possible. |
| + | Causes the resulting RE to match 1 or more repetitions of the preceding RE |
| ? | Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding RE |
| {m} | Specifies that exactly m copies of the previous RE should be matched; fewer matches cause the entire RE not to match.  |
| {m,n} | Causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as many repetitions as possible. |
 Tips: 
  -  a{6} will match exactly six 'a' characters, but not five
  - a{3,5} will match from 3 to 5 'a' characters

## The special sequences consist of '\' and a character
The special sequences consist of '\\' and a character from the list below. If the ordinary character is not an ASCII digit or an ASCII letter, then the resulting RE will match the second character. For example, \\$ matches the character '$'.

#### \number
Matches the contents of the group of the same number. Groups are numbered starting from 1. For example, (.+) \1 matches 'the the' or '55 55', but not 'thethe' (note the space after the group). 
#### \A
Matches only at the start of the string.
#### \b
Matches the empty string, but only at the beginning or end of a word. A word is defined as a sequence of word characters. Note that formally, \b is defined as the boundary between a \w and a \W character (or vice versa), or between \w and the beginning/end of the string. This means that r'\bfoo\b' matches 'foo', 'foo.', '(foo)', 'bar foo baz' but not 'foobar' or 'foo3'.

#### \B
Matches the empty string, but only when it is not at the beginning or end of a word. This means that r'py\B' matches 'python', 'py3', 'py2', but not 'py', 'py.', or 'py!'. \B is just the opposite of \b, so word characters in Unicode patterns are Unicode alphanumerics or the underscore, although this can be changed by using the ASCII flag.

#### \d
- For Unicode (str) patterns:
  - Matches any Unicode decimal digit (that is, any character in Unicode character category [Nd]). This includes [0-9], and also many other digit characters. If the ASCII flag is used only [0-9] is matched.
- For 8-bit (bytes) patterns:
  - Matches any decimal digit; this is equivalent to [0-9].

#### \D
Matches any character which is not a decimal digit. This is the opposite of \d. If the ASCII flag is used this becomes the equivalent of [^0-9].

#### \s
- For Unicode (str) patterns:
  - Matches Unicode whitespace characters (which includes [ \t\n\r\f\v], and also many other characters, for example the non-breaking spaces mandated by typography rules in many languages). If the ASCII flag is used, only [ \t\n\r\f\v] is matched.
- For 8-bit (bytes) patterns:
  - Matches characters considered whitespace in the ASCII character set; this is equivalent to [ \t\n\r\f\v].

#### \S
Matches any character which is not a whitespace character. This is the opposite of \s. If the ASCII flag is used this becomes the equivalent of [^ \t\n\r\f\v].

#### \w
- For Unicode (str) patterns:
  - Matches Unicode word characters; this includes most characters that can be part of a word in any language, as well as numbers and the underscore. If the ASCII flag is used, only [a-zA-Z0-9_] is matched.
- For 8-bit (bytes) patterns:
  - Matches characters considered alphanumeric in the ASCII character set; this is equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]. If the LOCALE flag is used, matches characters considered alphanumeric in the current locale and the underscore.

#### \W
Matches any character which is not a word character. This is the opposite of \w. If the ASCII flag is used this becomes the equivalent of [^a-zA-Z0-9_]. If the LOCALE flag is used, matches characters considered alphanumeric in the current locale and the underscore.

#### \Z
Matches only at the end of the string.

> (Note that \b is used to represent word boundaries, and means “backspace” only inside character classes.)

'\u' and '\U' escape sequences are only recognized in Unicode patterns. In bytes patterns they are errors.

Octal escapes are included in a limited form. If the first digit is a 0, or if there are three octal digits, it is considered an octal escape. Otherwise, it is a group reference. As for string literals, octal escapes are always at most three digits in length.

> Changed in version 3.3: The '\u' and '\U' escape sequences have been added.
> Changed in version 3.6: Unknown escapes consisting of '\' and an ASCII letter now are errors.

# Performing Matches
| Method/Attribute | Purpose |
| ------ | ------ |
| match()	| Determine if the RE matches at the beginning of the string. |
| search()	| Scan through a string, looking for any location where this RE matches. |
| findall()	| Find all substrings where the RE matches, and returns them as a list. |
| finditer()	| Find all substrings where the RE matches, and returns them as an iterator. |

```python
>>> import re
>>> p = re.compile('[a-z]+')
>>> p
re.compile('[a-z]+')
```
| Method/Attribute | Purpose |
| ------ | ------ |
| group() | Return the string matched by the RE |
| start() | Return the starting position of the match |
| end() | Return the ending position of the match |
| span() | Return a tuple containing the (start, end) positions of the match |

```python
>>> print(p.match('::: message'))
None
>>> m = p.search('::: message'); print(m)
<re.Match object; span=(4, 11), match='message'>
>>> m.group()
'message'
>>> m.span()
(4, 11)
``` 
# More Pattern Power
```python
>>> p = re.compile('(ab)*')
>>> print(p.match('ababababab').span())
(0, 10)
```
```python
>>> p = re.compile(r'\b(\w+)\s+\1\b')
>>> p.search('Paris in the the spring').group()
'the the'
```
# Modifying Strings
| Method/Attribute | Purpose |
| ------ | ------ |
| split()	| Split the string into a list, splitting it wherever the RE matches |
| sub()	| Find all substrings where the RE matches, and replace them with a different string |
| subn()	| Does the same thing as sub(), but returns the new string and the number of replacements| 

```python
>>> p = re.compile(r'\W+')
>>> p.split('This is a test, short and sweet, of split().')
['This', 'is', 'a', 'test', 'short', 'and', 'sweet', 'of', 'split', '']
>>> p.split('This is a test, short and sweet, of split().', 3)
['This', 'is', 'a', 'test, short and sweet, of split().']
```
```python
>>> p = re.compile('(blue|white|red)')
>>> p.sub('colour', 'blue socks and red shoes')
'colour socks and colour shoes'
>>> p.sub('colour', 'blue socks and red shoes', count=1)
'colour socks and red shoes'
```
